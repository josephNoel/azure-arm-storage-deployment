# Azure ARM Template – Storage Account Deployment

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to deploy an Azure Storage Account using an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template with PowerShell.  
It was built as part of my Azure Administrator (AZ-104) preparation to showcase Infrastructure as Code (IaC), parameterization, and deployment automation.

The template supports configurable storage account names, SKU selection, and outputs all primary service endpoints after deployment.
